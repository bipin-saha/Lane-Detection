# Lane Detection Using OpenCV

## High-Level Overview
1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Convert the image to grayscale to reduce computational complexity.
   - Apply Gaussian blur to smoothen the image, filter noise, and capture edges effectively.

2. **Edge Detection:**
   - Use the Canny edge detection algorithm to compute gradients and detect rapid changes in pixel intensity across all directions.

3. **Region of Interest (ROI) Selection:**
   - Define a region of interest using a polygon to focus only on the area relevant for lane detection.
   - Perform a bitwise AND operation to isolate the region of interest.

4. **Line Detection:**
   - Utilize the Hough Transformation to detect straight lines within the region of interest.

5. **Averaging Lane Lines:**
   - Average the slopes and intercepts of detected lines separately for the left and right lanes.
   - Compute a single averaged slope and intercept for each lane.

6. **Displaying the Output:**
   - Display the detected lane lines on the original image.

## Code Implementation

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def canny_edge_detector(image):
    # Implementation of the canny edge detection algorithm.

def display_line(image, lines, lane_image):
    # Display the detected lane lines on the lane image.

def make_coordinates(image, line_parameters):
    # Generate the coordinates for the detected lane lines.

def average_slope_intercept(image, lines):
    # Compute the average slope and intercept for each lane.

def region_of_interest(image):
    # Define and mask the region of interest.

# Main implementation using video feed or image files.
